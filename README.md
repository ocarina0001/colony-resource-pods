# colony-resource-pods
RimWorld mod that adds a new trio of resource pods. One holds a colonist, one holds a large pool of resources similar to the Crashlanded scenario, and the last is a small pool of resources similar to the Crashlanded scenario.

I wanted to play a scenario that sent proper resources to live off of instead of relying on the randomness of cargopods, so I made this out of my own necessity. The drop pod events do not happen naturally and can be assigned through the scenario editor.

Thank you to UdderlyEvelyn for helping out with code and allowing me to use her DropThing method.
